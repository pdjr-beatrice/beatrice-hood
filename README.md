## Description

The aft deck canopy consists of a forward section which supports several
large solar panels and an aft (canvas) section which provides weather
and sun protection for the aft deck seating area.

The canopy structure consists of four aluminium athwartship ribs each
of which terminates in sockets which accept the upper ends of 38mm diameter
GRP tube supports.
Rib 1 is immediately adjacent to the rear of the wheelhouse with the
bottom end of its GRP supports bearing on the engine air intake coamings
and the tubes fixed by clamps to the aft face of the wheelhouse.
The GRP tube supports for Ribs 2, 3 and 4 are terminated at their lower end
by adapters which provide a short, 22mm, terminal plug that inserts into
corresponding 25mm hull sockets, restricting movement of the tube in the
horizontal plane whilst ensuring that the weight of the canopy is carried
by the 38mm tube which bears on the hull sockets' flange.
The terminal adapters must be loose fit because the existing hull sockets
are not in perfect vertical alignment.

Ribs are tied together longitudinally by aluminium profile stringers.
A peripheral "stringer" consisting of a series of flat GRP plates
establishes a rigid, contiguous, horizontal, perimeter for the canvas
hood. The canvas itself is stitched to a rubber U-profile which locates
over the edge of the GRP plates. The canvas is tensioned by being pulled
forwards against Rib 2 by wrap-around tensioning straps. 

The canvas roof of the canopy is not connected to the canopy side
screens: rather the screens hang from a GRP rail which passes through
and is supported by the ribs in a way that positions it directly above
the aft-deck seating perimeter rails: the two rails together create
rigid top and bottom attachment points that are vertically aligned.

Each aluminium rib is fabricated from a handful of components: a 50 x
50 x 5 aluminium T-section, some lengths of aluminium scaffold pole and
some flat webs. If facilities for bending T section are not available,
then the web of each T could be cut from plate and a flat strip welded
to the top edge to form a T profile.

Each rib is pre-drilled for attachment of stringer, boundary plate
brackets and tie down shackles.

Solar panel and LED downlight cabling is concealed in the channels of
the aluminium profile stringers.

The structure can be disassembled and stored in the ship's engine room.
Ribs 1 and 2 are composed of two parts which must be separated for
storage.
